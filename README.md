# project-one

Build an application that houses two models: one model is a home bar list
and the second model is a log of cocktail recipes. The home bar list model accepts
a name and ingredients. The cocktail recipe model accepts the name of a cocktail recipe and
ingredients. The cocktail recipe view displays all submitted recipe names and allows the user to submit new recipes.
It also allows the user to click into the recipe names to view the ingredients, as well as edit the recipe and
delete the recipe. The bar view displays all created bar names (e.g. Connor's bar, Parvis' bar, etc.) and 
allows the user to create a new bar. It allows the user to click into the bar name to view it's ingredients 
and match all viable cocktail recipes that can be made with those ingredients. 
It also allows the user to edit the bar ingredients as well as delete the bar.
